# Unity Learn JR pathway
Unity Learn JR path is awesome, I would suggest it to anyone who wants to learn how to make games. It does also give important tips and tricks on what you should do in order to have a clean looking code. 

# Short Gameplay clip - (coming after I complete bonus challenges for Scene2)

In Unity Learn, there are some game logic challenges that are completely optional, they go from easy to hard, and generally include things that are beyond the scope of the educational material\ 
I find it fun to complete them, I will soon complete them when I have some spare time, and when I do, I will put a gameplay video here

# Notes
This project was done for learning purposes.\
I was away from unity for the last 2-3 months, to revitalize my skills and get faster for my future work, I followed the step by step tutorials by Unity. \
I completed this tutorial in 5-10 hours since I already knew how to use unity
